# Docker Frontend React App

This is a project displaying some work I did for a minimal React app that utilizes Docker to create images for develop, testing, and production environments.

To build the image once you have the repository cloned and are in the project dir, you can do one of two things:
- Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build`
- Run `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .` and then the Docker CLI will return an image created on build and you can copy and paste it into the next command: `docker run #{image_id}`

Either of these approaches will start up your development environement by installing all of your dependencies in a node:alpine base image and starting your dev server on port 3000 on your local machine.

## Other tech utilized
This project uses Travis CI to leverage CI/CD for a production environment by hooking into AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The app also utilizes an nginx server to host my production application on AWS.
